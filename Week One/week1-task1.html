        <h3>Father: Christopher Hlophe</h3>
        <p>Retired Electrical Engineer, he is very old school, enjoys gardening, watching football, board games and telling stories about his childhood (remeniscence - that is how you know they are getting old). Lately he has taken an interest in art and watches a lot of discovery channels.</p>
        <h3>Mother: Bonisile Hlophe</h3>
        <p>Mother: Fleet Controller, but we believe she superwoman, she only takes a day off if she is ill or when they force her to take her annual leave. Amazingly she still holds the famliy together like most mothers, comes back from work; cooks and cleans (even if the house is clean, because she like doing things herself). She loves pastery, she is really good at it and would bakeries a run for their money if one day she decided to go into the business.</p>
        <h3>Elder Brother: Wandile Hlophe</h3>

He is hardly home; mom has made peace with it, she only ask him to check in so we know he is okay. Oh! And he a poet, a really good one at that, he has been winning competitions since High School.</p>
        <h3>Me: Sihle Hlophe</h3>
        <p>IT student, self taught graphic designer. terrible dancer, I would not dance to save my life. I love gadgets, listening to music; die hard J. Cole fan and learning about the latest technologies. My life revolves around three things, my studies, my start up (Wldrms) and church.</p>
        <h3>Younger Brother: Phumlani Hlophe</h3>
        <p>This one changes courses so much that I do not know what he is studying now, but he is a born hustler; always have a trick up his sleeve - he is one person who always come through for you. And last but not least, he likes trends, lives for trends.</p>
